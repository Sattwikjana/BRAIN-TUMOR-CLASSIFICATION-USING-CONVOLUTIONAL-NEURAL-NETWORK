# BRAIN-TUMOR-CLASSIFICATION-USING-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK

Brain tumor detection poses a significant challenge in the field of medical imag- ing,
particularly in the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders. The pres- ence of
brain tumors can have severe implications on a patientâ€™s health and require prompt and
accurate identification for effective medical intervention. In many cases, the manual
interpretation of medical images, such as MRI scans, by radiologists is time-consuming
and subject to human error, leading to delays in diagnosis and treatment planning.
This study aims to address these challenges by developing a brain tumor de- tection
algorithm using a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN). The objective is to
leverage the power of deep learning to automate the process of tumor detection,
thereby reducing reliance on human expertise and enhancing the efficiency of diagnosis.
The findings of this study demonstrate that the developed CNN model effectively learns
and extracts relevant features from input MRI images, enabling accurate de- tection and
localization of brain tumors. Through rigorous evaluation and validation on independent
datasets, the algorithm achieves a high accuracy of 95.80% in 10 epochs in identifying
tumor presence and distinguishing between different tumor types.
